# Extension-er
Change extension of all files in a folder to any specified extension. It DOES NOT convert the files themselves. 

### Why should I use it?
If you need to change the extention of say 100 or 1000 files, then you to use the Extension-er app. It will do the job in under a second.

### How does it work?:
Suppose you have the following fiels in ../Desktop/temp
1. a.rtf
2. b.rtf
3. c.rtf
4. etc...

Using Extension-er you can change the extention of these files to txt (or any other) in a single click:
1. a.txt
2. b.txt
3. c.txt
4. etc...

1. Clone the folder
2. Make sure you have DMD and DUB installed on your system
3. Open up your terminal/console and 'cd folder_name" to the folder
4. type 'dub' and press enter
5. It will build exe file with the same name and then execute it
