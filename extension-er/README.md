# Extension-er
Change extension of all files in a folder to any specified extension. It DOES NOT convert the files themselves. 

### Why should I use it?
If you need to change the extention of say 100 files, then it's better to use the Extension-er. It will do the job in under a second.

### How does it work?:
Suppose you have the following fiels in ../Desktop/temp
1. a.txt
2. b.txt
3. c.txt
4. etc...

Using Extension-er you can change the extention of these files to rtf (or any other) in a single click:
1. a.rtf
2. b.rtf
3. c.rtf
4. etc...

### How to install it?
1. Clone the folder
2. Make sure you have DMD and DUB installed on your system
3. Open up your terminal/console and 'cd folder_name" to the folder
4. type 'dub' and press enter
5. It will build exe file with the same name and then execute it
6. To run it again, type 'dub' or './extension-er' and press enter
